Some highlights: that day we all got Irish coffees at Buena Vista Cafe; our SF marathon training runs, especially that long one through Glen Park and Lake Merced; your flute performance in Driggs; literally everything about Driggs; our progressive dinner when we shared custody of Kev in Covid; that one morning after Summer Formal when you… pulled an Alyssa; screaming Drivers License on the way to the Bakshis; dancing around the kitchen at your epic engagement party… the list is too long.

I am so thankful for the relationship we have developed, particularly as we lived together for most of 2020. How far we’ve come since the time I described you as “a nice BC girl,” - you are confident, smart, giving, ambitious, funny, with a laser pointed ability to roast and give crap. You’re particularly thoughtful - checking in on things in my life, and making family a priority. As I thought about favorite memories with you, recently they’re tied to family memories - dancing in the kitchen, flip cup with knives, Passovers and birthdays. You need no “hopes” or “wishes,” - you are crushing it. I’m lucky and proud to have you as a sister.\nLove,\nMaxine",

I had just finished wrapping some presents and went to open an email from her teacher at Guilderland H.S., which turned out to be a great present in itself.          I never deleted it and have attached it here to share with everyone who reads this book.\nDec 23, 2008 12:37:21 PM, lampmanh@guilderlandschools.org wrote:\nThis is my second year teaching your daughter. What a treat for me!!\nA few weeks ago, a professor from Siena was here to observe my student\nteacher. After class, he asked me, \"who was that student sitting there;\nthe girl?\"\n\"Oh,\" I said, after I figured the seat he was pointing to, \"That's\nAlyssa.\"\n\"She is really a good student, isn't she,\" he said.\n\"How can you tell,\" I asked.\nHe said he couldn't help noticing--she was so poised, so attentive, so\nobviously involved in the lesson. She asked some really good questions,\ntoo. And, he could see her taking notes at just the right time. She\nwas so clearly \"on task\" the entire time.\nAlyssa stood right out to him.\nI was really pleased. I told Alyssa this. I have thought of it many\ntimes since.\nOf course, it was obvious to me, but a nice surprise that it was so\nobvious to someone who must observe a large number of classes, and he\npicked out your daughter right away.\nAlyssa clearly demonstrates all of the skills and strategies that make\nan excellent student. She is also a fine young woman, and a lot of fun\nto be around.\nI know you are already proud of her. I just wanted you to know that I\nam, too.\nI hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday!!\nH. Lampman.\nMy advice, for what it's worth, is to stay humble and continue to treat everyone in your life as you currently do, with love and respect - even after you get that big MBA degree!\nMy wish for you is that you and Nate will have have a child as special as you are to me.\n  \nI can't wait to walk you down the aisle on your wedding day!\nLove, \n Dad \n",

I could repeat the same “auto-out” story from backyard baseball days, or tell you how annoying you were when you would tap dance around the house, or how you used to sing the soundtrack to \"Wicked\" over, and over, and over again. But on your 30th birthday, I'll set aside my outer ego.\n\tAs you know, our family is known for being loud, yelling, and picking on each other. We are not the ones that will kiss and hug, or ask each other “what was the best part of your day?”. It’s easy to get consumed by day-to-day life and forget to check in with the ones who mean the most. Even from 2,958 miles away, I feel like you are the one person in our family who does consistently. I remember in college I was going through a difficult time. I was struggling to be happy. You were one of the only people that I talked to about that. You gave me advice and told me to write something positive down each day or that I was thankful for. One of the things I am most thankful for is having a sister(s).\n\tAlyssa, you have been a positive light to all of our lives over the last 30 years. You (and Nate) are the glue to our family. I admire your kindness, and the joy you bring to each room you walk into. I am fascinated, and although it doesn't seem like it, envious of your drive in school and your ability to read the entire Harry Potter collection. I am inspired by your successes in all areas of life. Thank you for who you are, and the sister you are to me. Thank you for supporting me and accepting me. You’ve accomplished so much in your personal, school/work, and shall I say “athletic life” over the last 30 years. I can only imagine what you will accomplish over the next 30. Happy 30th Birthday, Alyssa! ",

I would say Alyssa, out of all my children, is the most happiest and joyous of all! Being the middle child many might think how could that be….but it’s true! Now don’t get me wrong, as a child she did have her annoying little habits. Some of which were “Am I going to wet the bed tonight” and “ is anyone going to take me?” This was an every night ritual, which believe me on some occasions, I was secretly thinking “geez I hope so!!”  Only kidding!!! She also worried about getting locked in stores and museums. I feel terrible that perhaps we gave her that uneasy feeling that for some reason we would do such a thing but perhaps it was because her dad did forget her at the baseball fields. And once her big sister Erica and her got somewhat separated from us in Provincetown, MA!!! Which of course would be a terrifying experience as a child! Throughout\nthe years Alyssa has become my bravest child in my mind! Flying back and forth across the country multiple times and practically around the world and a lot of the times by herself! I remember her flying to London alone several times and me worrying about her. But she never was afraid. Her bravery and determination astonishes me!!  \nShe’s beautiful and so smart. Her smile with her cute little dimples can melt anyones heart!!! She’s a caring daughter and was an adoring granddaughter to her Gramma. Alyssa would come home from college and immediately want to go visit Gramma. And how Gramma  would be so proud of her today as I am. She’s a confident young woman with a lot of wonderful qualities! No wonder she has so many really wonderful friends! My wish for Alyssa on her 30th birthday is to stay exactly the way you are!! Kind, energetic, intelligent, interesting, happy and most of all positive!! You keep me uplifted with your “words of advice” and sayings you inherited along the way from the Schlein family!! I’ll always remember when you were born and the nurses saying you were the most beautiful baby in the nursery! That still holds true today Alyssa!!! You are Miss America and I love you with all my heart…..Alyssa Mary Spaghetti !!  \nHappy 30th Birthday. So glad we’re here to celebrate it with you!!",

Freaking almost hard to believe that this day is here after so many memories, laughs, experiences, highs, lows, moves, new learnings, new friendships, car rides, endings, beginnings that we’ve shared and whether we’ve been near or far from each other, it’s been 11 years of our friendship and 30 years of YOU! I’m so so lucky to call you my friend. We both know we’re not the best at keeping in touch week to week but some of my favorite life memories have been with you. And the one that sticks out the most in our more recent years is the day of November 7th, 2020. That day we said goodbye to Driggs base camp, we got in the car, you dropped off a postcard for your nephew at the United States post office in Driggs, Idaho and at approximately 10am we found out we had a new President and became overwhelmingly emotional. Even sharing just that moment with you was so special. Your passion for equality, for hope in the future, for educating ourselves and those around you are qualities that I admire so much about you. And still, little did we know we would be embarking on a one of the most adventurous car rides of our lives. It’s hard to almost put into words all of the emotions we felt for those 10 hours in the car filled with chatter about our lives, singing along to musicals, truly praying that we would make it to our next destination but to date it’s been one of my favorite car rides. But that’s also what makes our friendship so special, we can be vulnerable with each other no matter the time we’ve spent apart. \n\nThat day and entire trip made us feel ALL of the emotions, from covid scares anxiety, to freely dancing in the moonlight, to bringing out our sillyness and choreographing a dance in a cabin, to competitively planking in the grass in front off the Tetons, to getting delirious & high and seeing record breaking Yahtzee plays, to taking our chances & peeing under big ass trucks, to eating salad out of a bag in a car, to praying we wouldn’t die in the worst snow conditions we’ve ever driven in, to having new found hope for our future. Reflecting on all of those little memories made me think of and also end up being my advice to you in this next decade… said in the wise words of Eliza Hamilton: \n\nNever forget to “Look around, look around, at how lucky we are to be alive right now.” \n\nMay you continue living this next decade of life with gratitude, love, laughter and taking every opportunity to create new long lasting memories. \n\nAll my love, Diana \nFriends since ‘11 ",
